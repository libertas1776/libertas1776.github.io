# My Time at Mitchell Community College
I started attending classes at Mitchell in January 2018. At that time, I was not sure what I wanted to study. I ended up choosing to study Information Technology. I have my mom to thank for this decision as she knew it would be a fulfilling career choice for me. My first classes didn't entirely sell me on IT until I took NET 125 with Robert Theisen and he opened my eyes to the fascinating world of networking. I can't thank him enough for peaking my interest in technology and being such a fantastic teacher.

## My Professors
I had many interesting and unique professors throughout my time at Mitchell, but none have left a greater impact on me than Robert Theisen and Gregory Cain. Their passion to instruct and guide others through the IT field is selfless and truly inspiring. 

## My Classes
I took many classes at Mitchell in a wide variety of subjects ranging from Python and Java coding to Cisco networking and working with Linux. I enjoyed all of classes as they challenged me in different ways and forced me to think outside the box. I am grateful to have learned about so many uniquee technologies. This has broadened my horizon and introduced me to so many avenues within the world of IT. 

## STEAM
STEAM was one of my most interesting experiences at MCC. STEAM stands for science, technology, engineering, and math. It is an event held at Mitchell's Statesville campus where middle school students come to learn about these subjects. As part of the technology team, I lead and helped lead groups of students learn about networking. We taught them about the history of computers, the basics of cybersecurity, and how to build their own LAN. By the end of each session, we had the whole class pinging each other and even using remote desktop to take control of each other's computers. This experience showed me how fulfilling instructing others can be and I'm so happy that I was able to participate.
