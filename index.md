# My Time at Mitchell Community College
I started attending classes at Mitchell in January 2018. At that time, I was not sure what I wanted to study. I ended up choosing to study Information Technology. I have my mom to thank for this decision as she knew it would be a fulfilling career choice for me. My first classes didn't entirely sell me on IT until I took NET 125 with Robert Theisen and he opened my eyes to the fascinating world of networking. I can't thank him enough for peaking my interest in technology and being such a fantastic teacher.

1. My Professors
I had many interesting and unique professors throughout my time at Mitchell, but none have left a greater impact on me than Robert Theisen and Gregory Cain. Their passion to instruct and guide others through the IT field is selfless and truly inspiring.
